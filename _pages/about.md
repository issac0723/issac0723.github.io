I am a first-year M.S. student in the [Informatics Department](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/) at the University of California Irvine, advised by [Dr.Elena Agapie]( https://eagapie.com/) in the unnamed lab. I also completed my B.S Informatics at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/).

My broad research interest is in health informatics and human-computer interaction. More specifically, I am interested in designing and developing innovative technologies to support people with all aspects of their holistic well-being through positive behavior change. My ultimate aim in life is to utilize technology to make the world a better place for everyone.

I am a night owl. Outside school, you'll find me:  
Snowboarding. Playing computer games(League of Legends). Obsessing with the Lego world. Spending time with my cat, Kitson.
