I am a first-year M.S. student in the [Informatics Department](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/) at the University of California Irvine, advised by [Dr.Elena Agapie]( https://eagapie.com/) in the unnamed lab. I also completed my B.S Informatics at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/).

My broad research interest is in **human-computer interaction(HCI)** and **health informatics**. More specifically, I am passionate about designing and developing innovative technologies that promote holistic well-being by facilitating **positive behavior change**. I am interested in exploring how computing technology can empower individuals to achieve their goals in a complex long-term process.  

My ultimate aim in life is to utilize technology to make the world a better place for everyone.I firmly believe that technology alone cannot bring about change; it is people who have the ability to do so. Technology can be achieved, but people must take action to shape the story.

I am a night owl. Outside school, you'll find me:  
Snowboarding. Playing video/computer games(The Legend of Zelda/League of Legends). Obsessing with the Lego world. Spending time with my cat, Kitson.
